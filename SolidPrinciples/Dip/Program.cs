//The DIP provides flexibility, testability, and modularity by reducing tight coupling between classes
//	or modules.
//  depend upon abstractions, not concretions

//• Don’t over-engineer your solutions (KISS).
//• Encapsulate and reuse business logic (DRY).
//• Organize elements around concerns and responsibilities (SoC/SRP).
//• Aim at composability (OCP).
//• Support backward compatibility (LSP).
//• Write granular interfaces/contracts (ISP).
//• Depend on abstractions and invert the dependency flow (DIP).
